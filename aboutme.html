        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Ginni Gallagher. I graduated from the University of Oregon in June 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science
            and a minor in Business Administration. <br><br> During my college years, I served as a student senator in the Associated Students of University
            of Oregon. In this role, I advocated for computer science students in the realm of university administration and policy. I additionally served as Director of Philanthropy
            for my sorority, Delta Gamma. I assisted in organizing our annual philanthropy event that attracted 100+ attendants and raised
            over $7,000. <br><br> As a student in the honors college, I was required to complete a thesis capstone project. My thesis topic focused on automating 
            user-preferred camera placements for scientific visualization. I researched this topic and wrote my thesis over the period of 12 months.
            At the end of my senior year, I defended my thesis in a 40-minute presentation in front of a panel of peers and 4 computer graphics and visualization experts.
            <br><br> After graduation, I moved from Eugene, Oregon to Los Angeles, California and began working as a part time manager at a retail franchise.
